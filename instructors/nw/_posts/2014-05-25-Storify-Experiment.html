<p>Created a quick page on <a href="http://storify.com">Storify</a> about <a href="http://storify.com/_nw_/jekyll-research/">Jekyll</a>. Pretty slick how easily you can add multiple types of media from a wide range of apis.<p>
<p>And now for testing the embedding of the story.</p>

<b>Update:</b>
<p>It appears that the markdown parser is struggling with the iframe tag. I had to revert to a html file to make this work. To be clear it actually worked in markdown but with some ugly source code showing as well.</p>

<div class="storify">
  <iframe src="//storify.com/_nw_/jekyll-research/embed?border=false" width="100%" height=750 frameborder=no allowtransparency=true></iframe>
  <script src="//storify.com/_nw_/jekyll-research.js?border=false"></script>
  <noscript>[<a href="//storify.com/_nw_/jekyll-research" target="_blank">View the story "jekyll research" on Storify</a>]</noscript>
</div>
