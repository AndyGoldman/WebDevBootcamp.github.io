This site is build using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). A static site generator with a bunch of nifty features helping development to move faster. Jekyll uses [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/), a templating engine that was created by [Shopify](http://shopify.com). It is extremely simple to use and was designed to have a low learning curve. Many companies use it like [Rackspace](http://rackspace.com), [Salesforce](http://desk.com) and [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com) to help customers customize their experience.

Shopify has put together a great set of resources on how to properly use and understand this technology.
